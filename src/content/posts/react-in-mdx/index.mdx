<section class="blog-section">

A bit over a year ago, <XA href="/blog/react-in-markdown">I wrote</XA> about why I was so excited for React in Markdown. (I'm still excited about it, by the way!) At the end of that post, I included a note about an interesting <XA href="https://spectrum.chat/frontend/general/mdx-proposal~1021be59-2738-4511-aceb-c66921050b9a">proposal</XA> for a `.mdx` format by ZEIT's Guillermo Rauch, which had been published just a day earlier. Fast forward to today and <XA href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx">MDX</XA> has over 6,000 stars on GitHub. Out of all the libraries in this space, MDX seems to be the clear winner.

## Old and busted: rehype-react

In addition to being <XA href="https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/">widely supported</XA>, it has a much better mental model than my previous approach to React in Markdown, which used <XA href="https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/custom-components/">rehype-react</XA> and had some ugly caveats.

For one, I couldn't figure out a good way to include only a certain subset of components in a certain blog post. (I made <XA href="https://github.com/prichey/prestonrichey.com/commit/a8ce453816815a98fcd15965db392d0044506cae#diff-12ec4011600ff4508b69acef7fcec340L5">a note</XA> to myself to try and figure this out but I never did.) Every single component (even the heavy ones that include libraries like Three.js) gets included every single blog post, regardless of whether not they are all needed. Not ideal.

This approach also requires that you pass all props to your embedded components as strings. The components I need for this blog are all fairly simple so this never was a huge issue, but if I wanted to do anything more complex this would quickly become a deal-breaker.

All this to say, React in Markdown is here to stay. `rehype-react`, not so much (at least for me). I'd been following `MDX` for some time, as well as <XA href="https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx">gatsby-mdx</XA>, which makes it easy to consume `MDX` from a `Gatsby` blog. I finally had some time after wrapping up a few projects (<XA href="/projects/personal/p4ktldr/" title="p4ktldr">1</XA>, <XA href="/blog/react-rust-wasm/" title="React + Rust + Wasm">2</XA>) and decided to bite the bullet and give `gatsby-mdx` a try. A few weeks later, I'm back up and running (<XA href="https://github.com/prichey/prestonrichey.com/blob/master/src/content/posts/react-in-mdx/index.mdx">this page</XA> is MDX!) and on the whole, a total convert! Here are a few things I learned along the way.

## New hotness: gatsby-mdx

I took the opportunity while updating to `gatsby-mdx` to also refactor a fair amount of this blog. That being case, <XA href="https://github.com/prichey/prestonrichey.com/compare/d347d89eccf0b2c8ba288efc0cdddcfd3254697c...master">the diff</XA> is fairly gnarly. After all, I initially wrote this site not long after learning React itself, and by now I've been writing React professionally for over a year. Still, I'll call out some of the steps that might be useful for someone else getting started with `gatsby-mdx`.

First, install your dependencies:

```bash
npm i gatsby-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/tag
```

Then, add `gatsby-mdx` to your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-mdx',
      options: {
        extensions: ['.mdx'],
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          // more on this later
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

Then, add a `.mdx` file to `src/pages` and you're off to the races! For this example, I'll use `ZoomImage`, like I did in my <XA href="/blog/react-in-markdown">previous post</XA>:

```js

title: "ZoomImage Example"
date: "2019-03-31"

import ZoomImage from 'components/ZoomImage';

import lake from './lake.jpg';
import lakeZoom from './lake-zoom.jpg';

<ZoomImage src={lake} zoomSrc={lakeZoom} caption='Lake 22, WA' />
```

And here's what it looks like:

<div class="blog-inset">
  <ZoomImage src={lake} zoomSrc={lakeZoom} caption='Lake 22, WA' />
</div>

## Some gotchas

`gatsby-mdx` 'just works' (usually).

On the whole, the assumptions made by the library are sane ones. But once in a while, I found myself fighting against the library to maintain the flow of data in the standard 'Gatsby-ish' way. Here are a few examples of things that took some figuring out.

### Configuring gatsby-mdx

In order to include components in your `MDX` files, you'll need to tell `gatsby-mdx` where to look. All of my components are in `src/components`, so I use the following configuration in `gatsby-node.js`:

```js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      modules: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'), 'node_modules']
    }
  });
};
```

Then in my `MDX`, I import like so:

```js
import Foo from 'components/Foo';
```

You'd think this would be at the top of most `gatsby-mdx` tutorials but it took me a bit of digging to figure out.

### gatsbyRemarkPlugins

If you already use Markdown in your Gatsby blog, it's likely that you use <XA href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/">gatsby-transformer-remark</XA>. `gatsby-mdx` is a full replacement for `gatsby-transformer-remark` (unless you opt to use them both, for reasons I'm unsure of). This means that you'll need to modify your `gatsby-config.js` to account for this.

`gatsby-mdx` accepts a configuration object, which has an option for `gatsbyRemarkPlugins`. Mine looks like this:

```js
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-mdx',
  options: {
    gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
      { resolve: 'gatsby-remark-autolink-headers' },
      { resolve: 'gatsby-remark-prismjs' },
      { resolve: 'gatsby-remark-smartypants' }
    ]
  }
}
```

I've read that some `gatsby-remark` plugins won't work out of the box with `gatsby-mdx`, but so far I haven't run into any issues.

### Programmatically rendering MDX

By default, `gatsby-mdx` will render your MDX in place. As shown in the example above, you can place a `foo.mdx` file in `src/pages`, and it'll be detected and rendered at `/foo` without any further configuration. This is great for getting up and running, but this doesn't completely map to the way that I use MDX in my app. I typically want my MDX files to be wrapped in a layout component, which might display the title, date, and other metadata about the post, as well as common styling.

In order to get access to your MDX files programmatically, you'll need to modify your `gatsby-node.js` to look something like this:

```js
const path = require('path');
const { createFilePath } = require('gatsby-source-filesystem');

exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    graphql(`
      {
        allMdx {
          edges {
            node {
              fields {
                slug
                type
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `).then(result => {
      if (result.errors) {
        console.error(result.errors);
        reject(result.errors);
      }

      result.data.allMdx.edges.forEach(({ node }) => {
        createPage({
          path: node.fields.slug,
          component: path.resolve('./src/templates/post.js'),
          context: {
            // Data passed to context is available in page queries as GraphQL variables.
            slug: node.fields.slug
          }
        });
      });
      resolve();
    });
  });
};
```

Then, in `src/templates/post.js` (or wherever you specified as your `component` path above), query via the slug we passed above:

```js
import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

export const query = graphql`
  query($slug: String!) {
    mdx(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      frontmatter {
        title
        date
      }
      code {
        body
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

And now your component should have access to `props.data.mdx`, with all of the fields passed above:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-mdx

import Layout from './components/Layout';

const PostTemplate = ({ data }) => {
  const { frontmatter, code } = data.mdx;

  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXRenderer>{code.body}</MDXRenderer>
      <span>{frontmatter.date}</span>
    </Layout>
  );
};
```

Note here that we're passing `props.data.mdx.code.body` to `MDXRenderer`, which is what renderers the compiled MDX content.

Passing your data around like this is certainly more tedious than letting `gatsby-mdx` render your content in place, but I find that this approach is necessary for anything other than toy examples.

### File imports

I've yet to figure out a completely ergonomic approach to including relative links to files, especially when passing to components as props. There seems to be <XA href="https://gatsby-mdx.netlify.com/guides/using-gatsby-remark-images">a working example</XA> in the `gatsby-mdx` docs showing how to use `gatsby-remark-images`, but this doesn't work with the custom `ZoomImage` component I use for image embeds. Previously, I came up with a <XA href="/blog/react-in-markdown/#zoomimage">hacky approach</XA> to this that worked with my previous `rehype-react` setup, but it included a silly `Hidden` component which was required for `webpack` to update the file path from a relative one to the published `public` directory. It worked, but was certainly not ideal.

The solution I landed on is to simply import any necessary files at the top of my `MDX` file, like so:

```js
import foo from './foo.jpg';
```

Then, later on, you can use it:

```js
<ZoomImage src={foo} />
```

The path to `foo` will be correctly updated to the public directory:

```
/static/foo-02dc7c71ecb7ee41bfaa345303af6736.jpg
```

Ideally, I would like to be able to pass the path directly to my component (`<ZoomImage src="foo.jpg" />`) and have `webpack` do its magic, but for now, my approach works just fine.

## Onward!

`MDX` is young. `gatsby-mdx` even moreso.

Things will continue to change (and break, probably), but I'm so happy that there's a growing community of developers working to improve the tooling and ergonomics writing Gatsby web applications. Special thanks to <XA href="https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi">Christopher Biscardi</XA> and the rest of the maintainers of `gatsby-mdx` for their hard work on such a useful and pleasant tool.
