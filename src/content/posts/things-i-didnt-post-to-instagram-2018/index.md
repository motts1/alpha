About a month ago, I wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq6S-gBhSlR/">some thoughts</a> on Instagram about my anxiety using social media:

> I get caught up in the specifics of turning a file on my phone and a memory in my head into a discrete cropped and edited chunk of social media. I know it shouldn’t be that difficult [...] yet I put off the work of posting (which really could and should be trivial), until time passes and I see or do even more things I would like to share, but don’t due to some silly devotion to maintaining a strictly chronological personal timeline

Turns out, this is something I've been dealing with for a while. From a previous Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BDe2FynGU94/">post</a>, in March 2016:

> I just typed out a paragraph musing on our 'modern anxiety' of being a 'social animal' with 'fragmented selves' (lol) to explain my lack of activity on this app, but I deleted it (you didn't want to read it anyway)

And, even earlier, in 2012, <a href="http://press10.tumblr.com/post/34686832586">on Tumblr</a>, after returning from a semester in Argentina:

> But once I got back it just didn’t feel right stringing the videos together like trout, dead and useful, picking the important ones from the unusable, and posting it online for anyone to watch without me by their side whispering in their ear all the extra details (and the extra details are both infinite and completely necessary).

I regret to inform you I still haven't figured it out.

But! I have figured out a few things out in this cycle of experience → anxiety  → resolution.

For one, I know that I'll probably always be hypercritical of my public output. I've always been self-conscious. Yet, trying to be aware of the way I am perceived,  focusing on self-improvement (and optimization in general) is what makes me
